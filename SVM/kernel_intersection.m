function K = kernel_intersection(X, X2)
% Evaluates the Histogram Intersection Kernel
%
% Usage:
%
%    K = KERNEL_INTERSECTION(X, X2)
%
% For a N x D matrix X and a M x D matrix X2, computes a M x N kernel
% matrix K where K(i,j) = k(X(i,:), X2(j,:)) and k is the histogram
% intersection kernel.

n = size(X,1);
m = size(X2,1);
K = zeros(m, n);

% HINT: Transpose the sparse data matrix X, so that you can operate over columns. Sparse
% column operations in matlab are MUCH faster than row operations.
X = X';
X2 = X2';
for a = 1:m
    for b = 1:n
        K(a,b) = sum(min(X2(:,a),X(:,b)));
    end
